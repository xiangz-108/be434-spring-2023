# Final Project: Cryptography

Congratulations on making it this far. You're almost at the end of the course. It's been an interesting and rewarding journey don't you think? Along the way you've learned the basics of Python syntax, including functions, conditionals, and for and while loops. And you've learned how to use the most common data types, like integers strings, lists, and dictionaries. You even learned how to declare classes and data types. While all along the way, testing your code and making sure it was robust. Now we're going to put all this knowledge together to solve more fun and exciting problems for our project.

Now, you are going to get a chance to put those piece together, in any way you can imagine, to code up some of the world's coolest ciphers. Let get started encoding! 

## Problem Statement

For our class project, we are going to dive into the world of cryptography. We will work our way through coding several historical ciphers; from the easily breakable Caeasar and Substitution Ciphers, to the more complex Vigenere Cipher. At the end, you will be able to send your friends and family secret messages, that they can decode with your code.

## Week 16: Basic Ciphers

We are going to start off with creating some basic cyphers. Each one of these Python programs can "re-use" a portion of the code from the previous program, moving from easy to harder ciphers. Be sure work through each of these in order.  

* 01_caesar: Caesar Shift
* 02_substitution: Substitution Ciphers

## Week 17: Complex Ciphers

Next, we will work on a more complex mathematical cipher.

* 03_vigenere: Vigenere Ciphers
